1. General UI/UX Principles
Consistency: Use consistent color palettes, font families, and button styles across Web and Mobile.

Micro-interactions: Add smooth micro-animations on button clicks, form submissions, drag-and-drop actions, and modal openings.

Minimalism with Details: Keep screens clean but add subtle detailed elements (shadows, glows, transitions) to make it feel lively.

2. Web Frontend (React.js + Vite)
2.1 Styling and Components
Tailwind CSS for rapid styling with custom theme extensions (colors, spacing, shadows).

Framer Motion for smooth animations (page transitions, modals, button effects).

Material UI (MUI) for ready-to-use, highly polished components.

2.2 Visual Effects
Parallax Effects: Subtle background movement when scrolling (use react-scroll-parallax).

Glassmorphism: Apply frosted glass effects on modals and cards (background blur + translucent backgrounds).

3D Button Hover Effects: Add slight scaling and shadow pop on hover using Tailwind and Framer Motion.

2.3 Animation Enhancements
Page Transition Animations: Use Framer Motion to animate route changes.

Loading Skeletons: Before content is fully loaded, show animated skeleton screens (@mui/lab/Skeleton or Tailwind custom skeletons).

Dynamic Drag-and-Drop Feedback: Animate cards snapping and bouncing when dropped on the Kanban board.

3. Mobile Frontend (React Native + Expo)
3.1 Styling and Components
React Native Paper or NativeWind for structured, theme-based design.

Lottie Animations for success, error, empty state illustrations (lottie-react-native).

3.2 Visual Effects
Smooth Page Transitions: Use react-navigation-shared-element to create shared element transitions between screens.

Animated Bottom Sheet: Integrate reanimated-bottom-sheet for modals and advanced options.

Gradient Backgrounds: Use expo-linear-gradient for beautiful screen backgrounds.

3.3 Animation Enhancements
Animated Task Cards: Animate task appearance with slight "fade and scale" effect.

Interactive Feedback: Haptic feedback on important actions (use expo-haptics).

Pull to Refresh Animation: Custom pull-to-refresh with bounce and color effects.

4. Color Palette & Visual Identity
Primary Colors: Shades of Blue (trust), Purple (creativity), and White (cleanliness).

Accent Colors: Soft Greens and Yellows for success or warnings.

Dark Mode: Full dark mode support with soft contrast (no pure black).

5. Bonus UI/UX Ideas
Gamification Elements: Add a "task streak" counter and small reward animations.

Confetti Explosion: Trigger a subtle confetti effect when a task is marked as Completed (Lottie or Framer Motion).

Voice Feedback: When a task is created via voice, have an optional success voice sound.

ðŸ“¦ Recommended Libraries Summary

ðŸ”” Important:
ðŸ‘‰ All animations should be GPU optimized (use CSS transforms, native driver animations) to avoid performance drops on mobile.
ðŸ‘‰ Test everything on low-end devices to guarantee smoothness.
